# SQL injection vulnerability-based login page CTF challenge

This challenge presents a login page with a username and password field. The backend of the login page uses SQL to authenticate the user's login credentials. The goal of the challenge is to exploit a vulnerability in the SQL query to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to the system. The challenge may require participants to use different SQL injection techniques such as UNION-based, error-based, or time-based injections. Successful completion of the challenge involves finding the correct SQL injection string that will allow the attacker to log in without a valid username and password.
